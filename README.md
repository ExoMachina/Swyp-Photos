About Sw每p
----------------
Pronounced 'Swipe,' Sw每p is a framework for transferring any file from any app, to any app on any device: simply with a sw每p. 

Interoperability
---------------
The core principal of Swyp is "if you export data, you support png."

* Swyp apps will have native file formats, and usually support many formats, but they must export PNG.
* Swyp supports streaming-data pathways for music, video, or multiplayer games.
	* This is not an excuse not to support PNG export
	* Get creative! Send album art, a frame from the video, or user's game stats 
	* iOS tip-- (just render a special UIView layer into an image context, then into a PNG!) 
* View the protocol outline included in 'SwypProtocol.md'

Implementation
---------------
* Everything in Swyp built on bonjour, sockets and streams
	* Though this is iOS code, there's no reason it can't be brought to Android and OSX
* Swyp is peer to peer
	* Swyp supports Wifi and Bluetooth pan (in supporting devices like iOS devices) -pending @ iOS 5
	* Swyp visually presents the user with all enabled Swyp pathways (so that users know to connect to the same WiFi, for example, or turn on bluetooth)
	* Swyp could eventually be extended to support connections over cellular connections, providing a service (like Bump's) was created by some future party
* Swyp currently is as secure as the host network
	* If the feature is widely requested, we can implement a tls certificate system as an extension
	* Insecure networks will have insecure file transfer, making Swyp about average in security
